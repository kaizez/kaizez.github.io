            <h2>Discovering my passion for computing</h2>
            <p>
                This was when I was in secondary one, I was very lost and was trying to find something that I was
                passionate about. I jumped from Gaming, to sports and ended up landing on computing.
                <br>
                <br>

                During the June holidays, I tried to gain more knowledge about computers. Initially, I was very
                interested in ethical hacking and wanted to pursue a path in penetration testing. Hence, I started
                scouring the internet for courses related to ethical hacking, which led me to virtual machines and
                operating systems such as Kali Linux. I also familiarized myself with the terminal as it is an essential
                application for hacking. I learned basic commands such as "ls", "cd", "pwd", etc.
                <br>
                <br>

                During this long holiday, I decided to continue from where I left off during the June holiday. Apart
                from learning the primary commands, I started to get familiar with various tools such as "SEtoolkit,"
                "Nmap," "Stormbreaker," and some DDoS tools. Of course, all of this was tested on a controlled virtual
                machine and was tested by me.

            <h2>A Change of Heart</h2>
            <p>
                As a secondary two student, I found ethical hacking and penetration testing interesting but wanted to
                try something new.
                <br><br>
                During the March holidays, I discovered a YouTube channel called "NetworkChuck" that teaches a wide
                range of computing topics, including penetration testing, web development, and networking.
                <br><br>
                With my newfound web development knowledge, I started Project 0070 to learn how to make a website from
                scratch and understand the programming language behind it. After researching free website hosting
                services, I chose 000webhost for its beginner-friendly features and tutorials.
                <br><br>
                I searched for a starter index.html page and learned the basics of HTML, such as the structure and tag
                pairs. I didn't create the content myself, as the project's purpose was to learn.
                <br><br>
                Project 0070 taught me the basics of HTML, using services like Cloudflare for SSL certificates, GitHub,
                and CodePen for reference. The best lesson was resilience; despite many uncertainties, I didn't give up
                and continued searching for tutorials. This project reinforced my love for computing. After its
                completion, I felt bored and unsure of what to do next.
            </p>

            <h2>Embarking on a new journeys</h2>
            <p>
                I have a password table where I store all my passwords and wanted to automate searching for them using
                Python. With no prior Python knowledge, I outlined my requirements: the code should prompt for input and
                display platforms related to the entered alphabets. I learned about user input and conditional
                statements through YouTube tutorials. This challenging project taught me valuable lessons, including the
                potential use of dictionaries for efficiency.
                <br><br>
                I then created a digital portfolio website for EAE, inspired by an online project. Building secondary
                pages linked to the main page, I improved my understanding of the 'div' tag and CSS for text alignment,
                button styling, and rounded edges. Although I faced challenges, such as configuring different styles for
                hyperlinks, I found solutions and learned to solve problems more efficiently. This portfolio project
                connected my previous knowledge with new skills, making it my most challenging and rewarding project.

            <h2>Fillin my toolbox</h2>
            <p>
                I started enrolling in online courses from Udemy, learning about cybersecurity, digital forensics,
                encryption, and cryptography. These courses taught me about malicious malware like viruses, worms, and
                trojans, and hacking techniques like brute force and DDoS attacks. I also learned the difference between
                cryptography (the science behind encryptions) and encryption (the action of concealing data). A
                misconception I had was cleared: while I thought decrypting the blockchain's SHA-256 hash could yield
                cryptocurrency, I learned that hashes are not meant to be decrypted, making such attempts pointless.
